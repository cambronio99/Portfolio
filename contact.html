      The following section is to complete requirements of the rubric, which I
      felt may have made the gallery a bit more overloaded than it already is if
      I'd included it there.
      <br><br>
      My Resume was completed in April of 2025 in CMST 495 <br><br>

      The Logos for Mastermind were done in Early 2024 at the Request of my
      Girlfriend's Mom <br><br>

      Pot;Luck Magazine and it's accompanying XD Prototype were completed while
      I was attending F.I.R.S.T. Institute in 2021, I created it to blend together
      some of my interests with my desired career in Web Design. I tried to infuse
      as much of my own personality into the magazine and app as I could, so I
      decided to lean into my own style, which is very "doodle" heavy, despite it
      not commonly being look upon as very professional.<br><br>

      The Cover art for TR1, 2, 3, and the Full Release of Tabula Rasa were all
      created in Spring of 2024. I wanted the covers to be simple, but convey a
      growth over time. The album was released in four parts, groups of two songs,
      and each group had songs with a common theme & similar time of recording.
      I will list the recording year of each song below: <br><br>
      2018 - montblanc <br>
      2019 - self-reflection <br>
      2020 - complicated & all for me<br>
      2021 - circadian rhythm <br>
      2022 - obnoxious <br>
      2023 - 2besureUcouldbreathe & museum <br>
